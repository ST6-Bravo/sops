## Airspace
NFNA ADC is responsible for the NFNA CTR consisting of Class D airspace `SFC` to `A025` within a **10nm** radius of NFNA ARP.

## Local Procedures

### Namuka Training Area
The Namuka Training Area is established west of the NFNA CTR, from `SFC` to `A040`, can be activated by NFNAA upon pilot request.

</figure>

When the Tiliva Training Area is activated, aircraft departing via **NAVUA** [shall be assigned](#sid-selection) the **CHARLIE** SID instead of the **ALPHA** SID.
## VFR Operations
### Departure/Arrival Gates
Aircraft should report at the standard VFR Departure/Arrival Gates.

| Direction from NFNA | Name | Dep/Arr |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| North | Verata | Both |
| North | Viwa | Both |
| East | Nasilai Lighthouse | Both |
| Southwest | National Stadium | Both |
| Southwest | Cement Factori | Both |
| Southwest | Nabila | Both 
| West | Naqali | Both |

## Helicopter Operations
### Helipads and Landing Areas
While there are no controlled helipads at NFNA, there are privately managed helipads within the NFNA CTR, including a helipad at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in central Suva.

Helicopters using these helipads be instructed to 'report on the ground'/'report when airbourne' in lieu of an explicit takeoff/landing clearance.
<!---## Runway Modes--->
## SID Selection
Aircraft planned via **LB VOR**, **MT NDB**, **NFNS**, **ATOLL**, **SAPIR**, **ISTOS**, **NAVUA**^, **NN VOR**, **MI NDB**, or **VK NDB** shall be assigned the **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Jet Aircraft **not** planned via any of these waypoints shall receive amended routing via the most appropriate SID terminus, unless the pilot indicates they are unable to accept a Procedural SID.

!!! note
	^ When the [Namukla Training Area](#namuka-training-area) is active, aircraft tracking via NAVUA shall be assigned the **CHARLIE** SID, NA VOR transition, thence direct NAVUA.

### Approach Expectation
If visual approaches are in operation the APCH field must state `EXP VISUAL APCH`.

## Coordination
### NFNAA
#### Departures
Next coordination is required from NFNA ADC to NFNAA for all aircraft entering **NFNAA CTA**

The Standard Assignable Level from **NFNA ADC** to **NFNAA** is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A040` and `RFL` |

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
NFNAA will heads-up coordinate arrivals/overfliers to NFNA ADC.

IFR aircraft will be cleared for the coordinated approach (Instrument or Visual) prior to handoff to NFNA ADC, unless NFNA ADC nominates a restriction.

VFR aircraft require a level readback.

!!! phraseology
    <span class="hotline">**NFNAA** -> **NFNA ADC**</span>: "via FNAWI for the RNP RWY 10, FJA81"  
    <span class="hotline">**NFNA ADC** -> **NFNAA**</span>: "FJA81, RNP RWY 10"
