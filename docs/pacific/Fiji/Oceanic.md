NFFF airspace from `A095` to `F200` is classified as Class D. NFFF airspace from `F200` to `F600` is classified as Class A.

### Reclassifications
#### NFFJ
When NFFJ is offline, the Fiji Domestic sector `SFC` to `UNL` remains uncontrolled.

!!! note
	Online coverage maps may incorrectly display the boundaries of NFFF with relation to NFFJ, an pilots unfamiliar with the airspace may make contact requesting ATS within the domestic sector. Gently advise such pilots to switch to advisory.

#### NWWWA TCU/NVVVA TCU
When NVVVA or NWWWA are offline, the Class D airspace `A095`-`F245` within their sector remains Class D but is delegated to NFFF. All controlled airspace below `A095`, including all offline TMA and CTR areas, are reclassified as Class G and administered by NFFF.

NFFF is **not permitted** to provide a top-down approach service in these circumstances.

## Extending
!!! warning "Important"
    NFFF is **not permitted** to extend to any adjacent domestic/international sectors.

## CPDLC
The Primary Communication Method for overfliers in NFFF is [CPDLC](../../../client/cpdlc).

The CPDLC Station Code is `NFFF`.

Voice may be used in lieu when applicable.

<!-- ## Sector Responsibilities

## Runway Modes
--->
## Surveillance Coverage
There are no radar services provided by NFFF; the sector is entirely [procedural](../../../separation-standards/procedural/).

!!! important
	In areas close to the domestic sector border limited surveillance coverage may be available. NFFF is **not permitted** use surveillance for separation.

## STAR Clearance Expectation--->

## Coordination
### NWWWA
#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus^; and
- Assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to NFFF CTA will be **Heads-up** coordinated by NWWWA.

!!! note
    ^Aircraft are *not required* to be tracking via the **SID procedure**, simply tracking via any of the terminus waypoints (Regardless of *departure airport* or *assigned SID*) is sufficient to meet the criteria for **voiceless coordination**

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **NWWW**; and
- Assigned `A100`; and
- Assigned a STAR (if **Runway 11** is in use); or
- Tracking to **LTO VOR** (if **Runway 29** is in use).

All other aircraft coming from NFFF CTA must be **Heads-up** coordinated to NWWWA prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

### NVVVA
#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`.

#### Arrivals
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **NVVV**; and
- Assigned `F250`.

### NFFJ
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.

### NSFA_CTR
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.

### Pacific Oceanic (TSN/NZZO/KZAK)
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#pacific-units), Voiceless, no changes to route or CFL within **15 mins** to boundary.
