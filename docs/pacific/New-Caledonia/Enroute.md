### NWWWA
#### Airspace
The vertical limits of the NWWW TCU are `SFC` to `F245`.

#### Arrivals/Overfliers
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- With ADES **NWWW**; and
- Assigned `A100`; and
- Assigned a STAR (if **Runway 11** is in use); or
- Tracking to **LTO VOR** (if **Runway 29** is in use).

All other aircraft coming from NWWW_CTR CTA must be **Heads-up** Coordinated to NWWWA prior to **20nm** from the boundary.

#### Departures
Voiceless for all aircraft:

- Tracking via a Procedural SID terminus^, **NIPOG**, **PULON**, **MESUS** or **ADKAD**; and
- Assigned the lower of `F240` or the `RFL`

All other aircraft going to NWWW_CTR CTA will be **Heads-up** Coordinated by NWWWA.

!!! note
    ^Aircraft are *not required* to be tracking via the **SID procedure**, simply tracking via any of the terminus waypoints (Regardless of *departure airport* or *assigned SID*) is sufficient to meet the criteria for **voiceless coordination**


### Pacific Oceanic (TSN/NFFF/NVVV)
