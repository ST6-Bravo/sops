## Local Procedures
### Start Clearance
Aircraft require clearance from AYMH ADC before engine start.

### Training Areas
The AYD903 (Mount Hagen) Danger Area is in the north-east AYMH ATZ, `SFC` to `A100`, and is used for flight training and practice approaches. The AYD907 (Waghi) Danger Area  is directly adjacent the AYMH ATZ, `SFC` to `A100`.

## Helicopter Operations
### Helipads and Landing Areas
There are no controlled helipads at AYMH. Multiple uncontrolled helipads have been established on the apron by private operators.

Helicopters also operate from landing areas at Mt Kaimunga (AYXK) and Mt Kegam (AYJK) within the Mt Hagen ATZ.

These helipads are outside the controlled maneuvering area and do not receive explicit takeoff/landing clearance. Helicopters using these helipads be instructed to 'report on the ground'/'report when airbourne' in lieu of an explicit takeoff/landing clearance.

## Coordination
### Departures and Arrivals
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#octa-coordination), coordination between AYMH ADC and AYPM is **not required**. However, a **5 minute** change parameter applies to any aircraft that change level, route, or taxi within **5 minutes** of the next sector's airspace.

### Overfliers
As per [Standard coordination procedures](../../controller-skills/coordination/#octa-coordination), coordination between AYMH ADC and AYPM is **not required**. However, a **5 minute** change parameter applies to any aircraft that change level, route, or taxi within **5 minutes** of the next sector's airspace.

IFR aircraft may either be handed off to AYMH ADC frequency by AYPM, or held on the AYPM frequency following coordination if there is no relevant traffic.

!!! phraseology
    *DEF tracking MUDIX H409 OKT*  
    <span class="hotline">**AYPM** -> **AYMH ADC**</span>: "via IKERU, DEF, any traffic or frequency requirements?"  
    <span class="hotline">**AYMH ADC** -> **AYPM**</span>: "DEF, No reported IFR traffic, no frequency requirements."  
    AYPM CTR will put *"AYMH NFR NIT"* in the label data, and the aircraft will remain on the ENR frequency.
